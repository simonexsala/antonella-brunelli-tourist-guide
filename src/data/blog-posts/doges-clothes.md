The corno ducale (ducal horn) was a tall, horn-shaped hat that immediately distinguished the Doge from all other Venetian officials. Made of stiffened fabric and typically covered in gold cloth or brocade, this ceremonial crown featured a pointed design that curved slightly forward at the top. The shape is thought to have evolved from Byzantine imperial headwear, symbolizing Venice's historical connections to the Eastern Roman Empire.

Remarkably, the most elaborate versions of the corno ducale were so heavily adorned with precious gems, pearls, and gold embroidery that they became impractically heavy for actual wear. During many ceremonies, these ornate versions were not worn on the Doge's head but instead carried or displayed near him as symbols of office – physical manifestations of Venice's wealth and power too substantial to be borne even by the republic's highest authority.

The rest of the Doge's attire was equally magnificent – flowing robes of crimson or purple silk, often trimmed with ermine fur, and embellished with gold embroidery. These robes, combined with the distinctive hat (whether worn or displayed), created an impressive figure that embodied the Republic's prosperity and political significance.
