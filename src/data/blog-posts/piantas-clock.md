In the Chapter Hall of the Venetian Basilica of the Frari, I will not forget, as your guide, to illustrate and explain to you a precious wall clock from the second half of the 1600s, carved in wood by Francesco Pianta. This clock features an elaborate and valuable iconographic message depicting the four seasons.  

After completing the visit to the Basilica dei Frari, I will take you to admire, also by Francesco Pianta, the relief decorations of the wooden dossals in the upper hall of the Scuola Grande di San Rocco.
