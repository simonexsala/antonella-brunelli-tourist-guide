In accordance with Italian Law No. 190 of December 13, 2023, and Article 13, paragraph 1, I have upgraded my status from a local tourist guide to a National Tourist Guide of Italy. I am now officially registered with card number 03000870.

Drawing on my experience, I have chosen to focus my professional activities in Verona, Venice, Soave, Monza, Lake Como, and Milan.

I have curated exclusive itineraries that I present as a National Tourist Guide, offering engaging and insightful experiences.

Please note that I am also a professionally registered Tour Leader & Tour Director.
