In accordance with Italian Law No. 190 of December 13, 2023, and Article 13, paragraph 1, I have extended my status from a Local Tourist guide of Milan, Monza and Lake Como to a National Tourist Guide of Italy. I am now officially registered with card number 03000870.

Tracing back through my family's venetian roots, I have chosen to focus my professional activities in these ancestral cities—Verona and Venice—as well as Soave, while also not forgetting the cities that initially gifted me the professional sensitivity and skills. 

I have curated exclusive itineraries that I present as a National Tourist Guide, offering engaging and insightful experiences.

Please note that I am also a professionally registered Tour Leader & Tour Director.
