Hello and welcome! I’m Antonella, and I’m excited to guide you through some of Italy’s most breathtaking and culturally rich destinations. With over 30 years of experience in tourism, I’ve had the privilege of exploring cities like Milan, Lake Como, Verona, and Venice, each of which holds a special place in my heart. My journey as a guide has also been shaped by a transformative experience in Ireland, where I discovered a passion for gardening that led me to study horticulture in County Kilkenny. 

I believe a true guide’s role is more than just showing landmarks—it’s about connecting you with the essence of a place. Whether through the art, history, local flavors, or even the scent of a garden, I look forward to sharing these rich experiences with you. Let’s explore Italy together!
