Following the Italian Law No. 190 of December 13, 2023, pursuant to Article 13, paragraph 1, I have transitioned from being a local tour guide to a national tour guide. I am now officially registered in the list of Italian national tour guides with card number 03000870.

Thanks to my previous experience, I have chosen to operate my professional activities in the following locations: Verona, Venice, Soave, Monza, Lake Como, and Milan.

I have designed unique itineraries that I now present and offer as a National Tour Guide, providing engaging and insightful experiences.
